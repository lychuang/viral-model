# viral-model
Vision:
- A basic-ass website where the user can test different parameters and see how viral spread changes.
- Inspired by the 3blue1brown video where they show various ways to model populations and virus spread

Implementation:
- most likely will do the data model and maybe graphs in python - pandas and numpy OP
- website could just have the app loaded as an embedded window, so no need for socketing
- front end: simple JS and NodeJS to host the app

Steps:
1. working on the python data modelling and customisability
2. creating a gui that allows user to change params and run the "case", seeing how infection rate changes
3. front end development
4. hosting on AWS or something?
